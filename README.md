# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was created using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), a tool to quickly set up a React application.

## Available Scripts

Here are the main scripts you can use in this project:

### `npm start`

Starts the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The app automatically reloads when you make changes.\
Any linting errors will appear in the console.

### `npm test`

Runs tests in interactive watch mode.\
Refer to the [testing documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more details.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production into the `build` folder.\
The app is optimized for the best performance and ready for deployment.

Learn more about deploying the app [here](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment).

### `npm run eject`

**Warning:** This action is irreversible.\
Ejecting gives you full control over the configuration (e.g., webpack, Babel, ESLint). However, it removes the built-in React scripts, and you will need to manage everything manually.

Use this only if necessary.
